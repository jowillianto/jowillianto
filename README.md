<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<h3 align="left">I graduated double major in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from KAIST :kr:.</h3>
<p>I am very keen in robotics and system programming related topics. One of the courses I really liked the most while I was an undergraduate student is about concurrency. </p>
<p>I used to really like C++ as a programming language and is now moving on to Rust as it is more modern.</p>

## Open Source Contributions
### [reflect-cpp](https://github.com/getml/reflectcpp)
Reflect CPP is a Moderna C++ Library that allows for pydantic style (i.e. serde style) serialisation in C++. By only declaring structs, one can serialize whole structs into JSON and many more other structures. 

## Hobby Projects
### [moderna-cli](https://github.com/jowillianto/moderna-cli)
Modern C++ modules based CLI Application Library. Batteries included, parses argument and attach actions to arguments made. Use only the `import` keyword without any includes. 
### [test-lib](https://github.com/jowillianto/test-lib)
Modern C++ modules based testing library. Batteries included, perform asserts on `std::expected`, create new tests with macros (sadly this means includes), and add your tests to `CMakeLists.txt` with a function. 
This includes sanitizers, etc..
### [moderna-process](https://github.com/jowillianto/moderna-process)
Modern C++ modules based subprocess spawning, spawn childs with system code and results returned through `std::expected`, no more worrying about any exception being thrown obnoxiously. Since, in this library,
only `std::bad_alloc` will be obnoxiously thrown. 
### [cpp-module-toolchain](https://github.com/jowillianto/cpp-module-toolchain)
Developing with C++ modules requires the newest of compilers. `cpp-module-toolchain` installs everything in a docker container and allows you to compile for the linux os. 
### [clrust](https://github.com/jowillianto/clrust)
Rust port of `moderna-cli`, uses very similar structures with a few upgrades.
